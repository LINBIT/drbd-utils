Drbd-utils for WinDRBD
======================

These drbd-utils can be also built for DRBD for Windows (WinDRBD),
except for drbdmon (coming soon) and drbd-84 utilities
(which don't and never exist for Windows, driver is based on DRBD 9)

To clone this, do a

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/LINBIT/drbd-utils.git

Build instructions
==================

You need a Windows (at least Windows 7) host with cygwin installed
to build this. To install CygWin, go to:

	https://cygwin.com/install.html

and follow the instructions there. Be sure to install the development
tools (such as gcc, autotools, make, ..) including flex (this is normally
not installed).

Once you are done installing Cygwin, do

	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/cygdrive/c/windrbd/usr --localstatedir=/cygdrive/c/windrbd/var --sysconfdir=/cygdrive/c/windrbd/etc --without-84support --without-drbdmon --with-windrbd
	make
	make install

If you are not already running bash as Administrator user, run the last
command (make install) as Administrator, else make install will fail.
