	</indexterm> DRBD automatically maintains a "hot" or "active" disk area
      likely to be written to again soon based on the recent write activity.
      The "active" disk area can be written to immediately, while "inactive"
      disk areas must be "activated" first, which requires a meta-data write.
      We also refer to this active disk area as the "activity log".</para>

      <para>The activity log saves meta-data writes, but the whole log must be
      resynced upon recovery of a failed node.  The size of the activity log is
      a major factor of how long a resync will take and how fast a replicated
      disk will become consistent after a crash.</para>

      <para>The activity log consists of a number of 4-Megabyte segments; the
      <replaceable>al-extents</replaceable> parameter determines how many of
      those segments can be active at the same time.  The default value for
      <replaceable>al-extents</replaceable> is 1237, with a minimum of 7 and a
      maximum of 65536.</para>
      <para>
	Note that the effective maximum may be smaller, depending on how
	you created the device meta data, see also
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>drbdmeta</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
	The effective maximum is 919 * (available on-disk activity-log ring-buffer area/4kB -1),
	the default 32kB ring-buffer effects a maximum of 6433 (covers more than 25 GiB of data)
	We recommend to keep this well within the amount your backend storage
	and replication link are able to resync inside of about 5 minutes.

      <para>Dynamically control the resync speed.  This mechanism is enabled by

      The goal is to either fill the buffers along the data path with a defined

      <para>DRBD has three methods of handling the ordering of dependent write
      requests:
	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><option>disk-barrier</option></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Use disk barriers to make sure that requests are written to
	      disk in the right order. Barriers ensure that all requests
	      submitted before a barrier make it to the disk before any
	      requests submitted after the barrier.  This is implemented using
	      'tagged command queuing' on SCSI devices and 'native command
	      queuing' on SATA devices. Only some devices and device stacks
	      support this method. The device mapper (LVM) only supports
	      barriers in some configurations.</para>

	      <para>Note that on systems which do not support
	      disk barriers, enabling this option can lead to data loss or
	      corruption. Until DRBD 8.4.1, <option>disk-barrier</option> was
	      turned on if the I/O stack below DRBD did support barriers.
	      Kernels since linux-2.6.36 (or 2.6.32 RHEL6) no longer allow to
	      detect if barriers are supported. Since drbd-8.4.2,
	      this option is off by default and needs to be enabled explicitly.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><option>disk-flushes</option></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Use disk flushes between dependent write requests, also
	      referred to as 'force unit access' by drive vendors. This forces
	      all data to disk. This option is enabled by default.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term><option>disk-drain</option></term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Wait for the request queue to "drain" (that is, wait for
	      the requests to finish) before submitting a dependent write
	      request. This method requires that requests are stable on disk
	      when they finish. Before DRBD 8.0.9, this was the only method
	      implemented. This option is enabled by default. Do not disable
	      in production environments.
	    </para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	</variablelist>
	From these three methods, drbd will use the first that is enabled and
	supported by the backing storage device.  If all three of these options
	are turned off, DRBD will submit write requests without bothering about
	dependencies. Depending on the I/O stack, write requests can be
	reordered, and they can be submitted in a different order on different
	cluster nodes. This can result in data loss or corruption. Therefore,
	turning off all three methods of controlling write ordering is strongly
	discouraged.
      </para>

      <para>A general guideline for configuring write ordering is to use disk
      barriers or disk flushes when using ordinary disks (or an ordinary disk
      array) with a volatile write cache. On storage without cache or with a
      battery backed write cache, disk draining can be a reasonable
      choice.</para>

      <para>If the lower-level device on which a DRBD device stores its data does
      not finish an I/O request within the defined
      <option>disk-timeout</option>, DRBD treats this as a failure. The
      lower-level device is detached, and the device's disk state advances to
      Diskless.  If DRBD is connected to one or more peers, the failed request
      is passed on to one of them.</para>

      <para>This option is <emphasis>dangerous and may lead to kernel panic!</emphasis></para>

      <para>"Aborting" requests, or force-detaching the disk, is intended for
      completely blocked/hung local backing devices which do no longer
      complete requests at all, not even do error completions.  In this
      situation, usually a hard-reset and failover is the only way out.</para>

      <para>By "aborting", basically faking a local error-completion,
      we allow for a more graceful swichover by cleanly migrating services.
      Still the affected node has to be rebooted "soon".</para>
      <para>By completing these requests, we allow the upper layers to re-use
      the associated data pages.</para>

      <para>If later the local backing device "recovers", and now DMAs some data
      from disk into the original request pages, in the best case it will
      just put random data into unused pages; but typically it will corrupt
      meanwhile completely unrelated data, causing all sorts of damage.</para>

      <para>Which means delayed successful completion,
      especially for READ requests, is a reason to panic().
      We assume that a delayed *error* completion is OK,
      though we still will complain noisily about it.</para>
      <para>The default value of
      <option>disk-timeout</option> is 0, which stands for an infinite timeout.

	There are several aspects to discard/trim/unmap support on linux
	block devices.  Even if discard is supported in general, it may fail
	silently, or may partially ignore discard requests.  Devices also
	announce whether reading from unmapped blocks returns defined data
	(usually zeroes), or undefined data (possibly old data, possibly
	garbage).
	</para><para>
	If on different nodes, DRBD is backed by devices with differing discard
	characteristics, discards may lead to data divergence (old data or
	garbage left over on one backend, zeroes due to unmapped areas on the
	other backend). Online verify would now potentially report tons of
	spurious differences.  While probably harmless for most use cases
	(fstrim on a file system), DRBD cannot have that.
	</para><para>
	To play safe, we have to disable discard support, if our local backend
	(on a Primary) does not support "discard_zeroes_data=true".  We also have to
	translate discards to explicit zero-out on the receiving side, unless
	the receiving side (Secondary) supports "discard_zeroes_data=true",
	thereby allocating areas what were supposed to be unmapped.
	</para><para>
	There are some devices (notably the LVM/DM thin provisioning) that are
	capable of discard, but announce discard_zeroes_data=false.  In the case of
	DM-thin, discards aligned to the chunk size will be unmapped, and
	reading from unmapped sectors will return zeroes. However, unaligned
	partial head or tail areas of discard requests will be silently ignored.
	</para><para>
	If we now add a helper to explicitly zero-out these unaligned partial
	areas, while passing on the discard of the aligned full chunks, we
	effectively achieve discard_zeroes_data=true on such devices.
	</para><para>
	Setting <option>discard-zeroes-if-aligned</option> to <option>yes</option>
	will allow DRBD to use discards, and to announce discard_zeroes_data=true,
	even on backends that announce discard_zeroes_data=false.
	</para><para>
	Setting <option>discard-zeroes-if-aligned</option> to <option>no</option>
	will cause DRBD to always fall-back to zero-out on the receiving side,
	and to not even announce discard capabilities on the Primary,
	if the respective backend announces discard_zeroes_data=false.
	</para><para>
	We used to ignore the discard_zeroes_data setting completely.  To not
	break established and expected behaviour, and suddenly cause fstrim on
	thin-provisioned LVs to run out-of-space instead of freeing up space,
	the default value is <option>yes</option>.

	</indexterm>In setups involving a DRBD-proxy and connections that experience a lot of
        buffer-bloat it might be necessary to set <option>ping-timeout</option> to an
        unusual high value. By default DRBD uses the same value to wait if a newly
        established TCP-connection is stable. Since the DRBD-proxy is usually located
        in the same data center such a long wait time may hinder DRBD's connect process.</para>
	<para>In such setups <option>socket-check-timeout</option> should be set to
	at least to the round trip time between DRBD and DRBD-proxy. I.e. in most
	cases to 1.</para>
	<para>The default unit is tenths of a second, the default value is 0 (which causes
        DRBD to use the value of <option>ping-timeout</option> instead).

	On each node and for each device, DRBD maintains a bitmap of the

	For example, in a three-node setup (nodes A, B, C) each with a single

      <para>When nodes receive write requests, they know how to update the
	bitmaps for the writing node, but not how to update the bitmaps between
	themselves.  In this example, when a write request propagates from node
	A to B and C, nodes B and C know that they have the same data as node
	A, but not whether or not they both have the same data.</para>

      <para>As a remedy, the writing node occasionally sends peer-ack packets
	to its peers which tell them which state they are in relative to each
	other.</para>

      <para>The <option>peer-ack-window</option> parameter specifies how much
