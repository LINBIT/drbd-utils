 * fix drbdadm crashes in set-gi and new-current-uuid
 * new peer_device option (--bitmap=no) to indicate that for this peer
   no bitmap slot should be allocated in the meta-data; This is used
   by all peers of a (configured) diskless node; saves bitmap-slots,
   thus allows you to use smaller max-peers numbers, thus saves memory
   and CPU resources
 * removed sh-status from v9

8.9.8
--------
 * fix a lot of regressions from allowing to pass command options
   on the drbdadm adjust commandline. (filtering of backend options)

   the configuration file when calling drbdsetup
 * new resource option max-io-depth (v9 only)
 * allow partial adjust by --skip-disk and/or --skip-net
 * support for a new meta-data flag that helps resize operations
 * workaround for sysfs entries and del_gendisk and add_disk;
   in case drbdsetup sees those sysfs entries it exits immediately,
   that prevents half initialized drbd devices that can not be removed
 * drbdadm resize waits until new new size is user visible
 * support for the reload operation in the OCF resource agent
 * drbdadm's parser now reports too long strings with a meaningful
   error message

   to 1000 resources

  * Document the events2 command on the drbd-8.4 man page
  * Fix environment variables for handlers

8.9.3

    and del-peer commands of drbd-9.0.0; drbdadm support for the new
    commands

    file for the common section of a resource can be specified

    describing drbdsetup options
  * No longer try to set peer-device-options with the connect or attach
    commands; Only do it with the up and attach commands
