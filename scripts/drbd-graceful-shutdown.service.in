# This unit gets "started" by udev at the moment of the first drbd
# device gets created (starting it is a no-op). At system shutdown, it
# ensures that all drbd resources shut down gracefully before the
# machine stops the networking.

[Unit]
Description=ensure all DRBD resources shut down gracefully at system shut down
Documentation=man:drbd-graceful-shutdown.service(7)

# The whole point of this is to try to demote DRBD while the network
# is still up and DRBD still has a chance to communicate with its peers.
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

# This is to try to gracefully shut down DRBD you forgot to shutdown.
# The per-resource template drbd@.service has a reverse dependency.
# But maybe they still use the "global" activation service.
# Don't try to demote DRBD while "drbd.service" is still running.
Before=drbd.service

# Don't shut down DRBD while Pacemaker is still running!
