Description=Promotion of DRBD resource %I
PartOf=drbd-services@%i.target

Requires=drbd@%i.target
After=drbd@%i.target

## If you want to "escalate" to self-fence
## after a failed demote:
# FailureAction=reboot
## If your systemd does not know "ExecCondition",
## and you have to change that to "ExecStart",
## you will need to NOT use FailureAction here,
## because that would also trigger for failed promote.
## In that case, use OnFailure below (which has the FailureAction set)
# OnFailure=drbd-demote-or-escalate@%i.service
OnFailureJobMode=replace-irreversibly
